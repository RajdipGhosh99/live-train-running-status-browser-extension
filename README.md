## 🛠️ How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Browse Booking Site] --> B[Live Delay Badge]
    B --> C{Checked in Memory?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Instant Display]
    C -->|No| E[National Rail Gateway]
    E --> D
    D --> F[Show Live Delay & Station]
```

1. When you search for tickets on any supported booking site, the extension automatically identifies train listings.
2. Click **Check Live** (or use **Fetch All Delays**) to retrieve the current running delay and station location.
3. Live results are displayed directly on the train card so you can pick the most punctual train before booking.

---

## ⚙️ Customization & Settings

Open **Settings** by clicking the gear icon ⚙️ in the extension popup or via browser extensions menu:
- **Badge Placement:** Choose whether badges appear beside the train name, below it, or in the top-right corner.
- **Data Saver Memory:** Customize how long checked trains are remembered (`0`, `1`, `5`, or `15` minutes).
- **Backup Data Sources:** Add optional RapidAPI or IndianRailAPI backup keys for automatic failover.
- **Site Controls:** Enable or pause badges for specific booking sites.

## 🧪 Automated Playwright Multi-Tab E2E Testing & Single-Source Architecture

The extension features a comprehensive, high-performance E2E testing framework powered by **Playwright** (`playwright`) testing real live production websites without mock fixture URLs:

    Config["Single-Source Config (src/portals/configs/)"] --> Runtime["Extension Content Adapters"]
    Config --> Playwright["Playwright Sequential E2E Runner"]

    end
    
    Playwright --> SequentialFlow
    SequentialFlow --> Evidence["Crisp Test Evidence & Screenshots"]
```

### 1. Single Source of Truth (`src/portals/configs/`)
- All portal URL templates, DOM selectors (cards, titles, anchors), badge positioning rules, and popup interaction parameters are defined once in `src/portals/configs/` (`types.ts`, `routing.ts`, `*.config.ts`).
- Imported directly by both the extension runtime adapters and the E2E test runner, eliminating duplicate configurations.

### 2. Live Sequential Execution & Validation (One Provider at a Time)
- **Isolated Headful Browser Tabs:** Opens one provider at a time in headful Chromium, verifies all test cases, captures screenshot evidence, and closes the tab before proceeding to the next provider. This prevents CDN socket throttling, memory bloat, and tab clutter.
- **Dynamic Badge Position Switching:** Every provider is automatically verified across all 3 supported badge positions:
  - `beside-name`: Positioned inline beside train title with pixel-perfect alignment ($\Delta Y \le 6\text{px}$).
  - `card-header-right`: Positioned in card header or right-aligned.
  - `below-name`: Positioned directly underneath the train title.
- **Dedicated Hover Popover Interactivity:**
  - Standardized color system: `box-late` (crimson red) for delayed status, `box-ontime` (emerald green) for on-time status, and `box-neutral` (mature slate) for 4-week typical runs and punctuality ratings.
  - Formatted strictly as 24-hr clock duration (e.g. `04:49` or `00:00`) with zero raw minute counts (`289m Late`).
  - Clean physical station location micro-banner with zero redundant delay text.
  - Action footer featuring compact 24-hour update clock (`Updated: HH:MM`) and interactive **Copy** and **Refresh** buttons.

### 3. Native Extension UI & Settings Dashboard E2E Testing (`npm run test:ui`)
- **Direct Extension Context Execution:** Boots Google Chrome with unpacked extension loaded, inspects the active Service Worker runtime to dynamically resolve the generated extension ID (`chrome-extension://<id>/`).
- **Options Dashboard Verification (`options.html`):** Tests navigation across all 6 sections (General, On-Demand, Providers, Caching, Compliance, Release History), verifies dynamic data provider card rendering, and tests live cache clearing actions.
- **Popup Quick Search Verification (`popup.html`):** Validates master toggle switch transitions, recent search chips, quick train lookup input, and real-time live delay status card rendering.
